# 🐍 Python Internship Projects – Codveda Technology

This repository contains four Python projects developed as part of my internship with **Codveda Technology**.  
The tasks span **Beginner** and **Intermediate** levels, showcasing both foundational programming skills and practical applications.

## 📂 Project List

### 🔹 Beginner Level
1. **Simple Calculator**
   - Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
   - Handles division by zero with error messages.
   - Command-line interface for user input.

2. **Number Guessing Game**
   - Randomly generates a number between 1 and 100.
   - User guesses with feedback ("Too high" / "Too low").
   - Limited attempts, exits when guessed correctly or attempts run out.

### 🔹 Intermediate Level
3. **To-Do List Application**
   - Command-line app to manage tasks.
   - Features: add, view, delete, mark as done.
   - Stores tasks in a JSON file for persistence.
   - Includes error handling for invalid task numbers.

4. **Data Scraper**
   - Fetches webpage content using `requests`.
   - Parses HTML with `BeautifulSoup`.
   - Extracts specific data (e.g., headlines).
   - Saves results into a CSV file.
   - Handles errors such as failed requests or invalid responses.
